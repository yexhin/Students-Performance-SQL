# ‚ôæÔ∏è **Students Performance**

## ‚úç Description:
- In a class, it is important to oversee the performance of students to help them address their weaknesses or develop their strengths. SQL is a powerful tool that can assist with this task.
- In this mini-project, PostgreSQL is the main tool. By using it, we can gain an overall understanding of the performance of students in a school based on their scores in Math, Reading, and Writing. With this information, teachers can adjust their academic plans to accommodate each group of students.
- Techniques such as CTE (Common Table Expressions), GROUP BY, and AVG will be employed to analyze and summarize the data, allowing for targeted insights into student performance.
- The dataset I used for this project consisting of 1,001 rows and 7 columns: gender, race ethnicity, parental level of education, math score, reading score, and writing score.

  
## ‚ú™ Usage:
This project is designed to be completed in the following steps:
1. Download the dataset "StudentPerformance" from Kaggle.
2. Create an outline for the table "performance" which contains the dataset.
3. Copy the data from file .csv to the table.
4. Using the techniques such as CTE, GROUP BY, JOIN, AVG, and so on to query the necessary that we think is crucial.
5. Using PowerBi to visualize the queries.
